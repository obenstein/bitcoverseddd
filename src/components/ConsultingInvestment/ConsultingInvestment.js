        <p className="text-base text-[#7e7e7e] pb-5">
          BITCOVERSE has a team of Professional Consultants with an impeccable
          history of over 9 years of successful experience (only the last five
          years have been tracked under our Trade Performances Year by Year
          informative page). The company’s Principal started consulting
          initially in a discretionary capacity and more recently having evolved
          into an advanced systematic approach.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-[#7e7e7e] pb-5">
          After having studied Bitcoin for some time, the firm's Principal was
          struck by the resemblance with commodities as those developed into
          investable asset markets from the mid-1990s onwards.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-[#7e7e7e]">
          The aim of BITCOVERSE Professional Management Consulting is to provide
          maximum exposure to the price movements of cryptocurrencies while
          managing the risks associated with such which come with being involved
          in an exciting new emerging market. Bitcoin's acceptance has grown
          rapidly as investors have begun to recognize the value of an asset
          with limited issuance, insulated from the effects of any country's
          monetary policy and is paving the way for Alt Coins to have a place as
          well. BITCOVERSE has a proven track record managing the risks and
          inherent volatility while outperforming the US Dollar index over the
          long term. We bring wide-ranging expertise and research into the
          drivers behind cryptocurrencies; investing long, short and trading, in
          order to produce outstanding return on investments.
